  abstract = {This study uses the flash drought intensity index ({FDII}) to develop a multivariate flash drought climatology for the contiguous U.S. using data from 2001 to 2021. The {FDII} method uses the rate of intensification ({FD}-{INT}) and subsequent drought severity ({DRO}-{SEV}) to determine when a flash drought occurred and the strength of the event. Overall, the results showed that flash drought occurrence and severity varied with season and region and were sensitive to the drought indicator used to compute the {FDII}. Precipitation-based indicators identified more flash droughts across the western U.S. whereas soil moisture ({SM}) and evapotranspiration indicators identified more flash droughts across the central and eastern U.S. When assessed over the entire U.S., the most flash droughts were found when using an evaporative demand indicator. Though {FD}-{INT} was larger than {DRO}-{SEV} across the U.S. for most indicators, regional patterns were also evident in their relative importance. For example, a distinct east-west gradient was present in the {SM} and evapotranspiration {FD}-{INT}, with relatively large values in the central and eastern U.S. A combined data set synthesizing information from multiple indicators showed that the strongest flash droughts from a multivariate perspective were located in the central and southeastern U.S. A seasonal analysis revealed a distinct seasonal cycle in flash drought onset across the western and central U.S. Together, the results illustrate the need to use a multivariate framework to identify and characterize the occurrence and severity of flash droughts.},
